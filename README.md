# FastChat

This code is developed and maintained by Ayush Agarwal, Sankalan Baidya and Soham Joshi as a part of the CS251-course project as a part of the autumn semester of the academic year 2022-23. 

In this project, we have used the following softwares : 
         * Python 3.8
         * PostGreSQL

For running the code, the following modules have to be installed in python : 

          - rsa
          - random
          - psycopg2
          - io
          - tkinter
          - PIL
          - socket
          - threading
          - json
          - bcrypt
          - numpy

In addition, we have used the versions Python 3.8 and PostGreSQL 15.1

In order to run the code, the following steps have to be performed : 

         1. python3 server.py 1234
         2. python3 server.py 1235
         3. Run multiple servers in a similar fashion
         4. python3 client.py
         5. Run multiple clients in a similar fashion 

Now, once the tkinter window is opened, the following options are available : 

1. Sign Up : This is for users who are new to the platform and do not have an account yet 

2. Join : This is for users who have signed up previously 

3. Create/Amend Group : This is for users to create new groups or add/remove people in groups they are part of. 

4. Join Group : Allows users to switch between groups they are part of. 

5. Send Image : This allows the users to send images on the groups or in direct messages by selecting a file on their PC. 

6. Chatbox : Simply typing the messages in the chatbox and pressing enter sends the message in the chatroom :)
